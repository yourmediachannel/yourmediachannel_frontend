      question: "Is this only for Instagram or other platforms too?",
      answer:
        "Right now, we're hyper-focused on Instagram only. That means we’re dialed into strategies that work *specifically* on IG — from story funnels to content + DM combo that converts.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need a big following for this to work?",
      answer:
        "Not at all. You can get high-quality leads even with under 1,000 followers. It’s about targeting, positioning, and messaging — not vanity metrics.",
    },
    {
      question: "What do you actually do in the process?",
      answer:
        "We handle strategy, creative, ad setup, targeting, testing, optimization — and send you regular performance reports. It’s fully done-for-you unless you want hybrid support.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is this for ecom or services?",
      answer:
        "Mainly service-based brands (coaches, freelancers, local biz), but we also help personal brands & consultants. If you're selling high-trust offers, this is built for you.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to see results?",
      answer:
        "Most campaigns start seeing traction within 2–3 weeks. But for optimized results and scaling, we recommend 30–60 days of consistent tracking and iteration.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I book a call first?",
      answer:
        "Yep. Just DM us “GROW” or use the call booking link. We'll audit your IG + give a roadmap with no pressure to buy.",
    },
